            Two years ago, I started <strong>BASO Project</strong> with my high school team, and we were able to develop some important technology projects such as <strong>CanSat Project</strong>, the competition organized by the <strong>ESA</strong>, which gives an opportunity to <strong>young students</strong> to start in the tech world.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the same time I was <strong>learning</strong> Front-end Development, my team and I were <strong>building the CanSat</strong>, we did a lot of work to make it <strong>become real</strong>, many tests and reports that we <strong>delivered</strong> to the ESA to confirm our participation and for other reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, I am <strong>expanding my knowledge</strong> to new technologies and languages through out Front-end development mainly, even so, I am open to learn Back-end as <strong>my final goal</strong> is to be a Full Stack developer.
